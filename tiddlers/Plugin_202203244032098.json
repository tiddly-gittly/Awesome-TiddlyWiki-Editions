After the first click you will see the bottom tiddler on top (`#bottom` will be appended to the URL); after the second click you get to the bottom of the tiddler to be edited\n#* The next time you click the 'Go to bottom' button you get to the bottom of the tiddler to be edited directly\n# After using the button a refresh of the ~TiddlyWiki opens the `bottom` tiddler and ''not'' the tiddler(s) programmed in Control panel.<br>You can click the Home button (<<icn $:/core/ui/Buttons/home>>) in the `bottom` tiddler to get the tiddlers as expected after a refresh, but see the ''Note'' below.\n\n<<<\n''Note:''\n\n* The Home button appends a `#` to the URL thus replacing `#bottom` by `#`\n* After clicking the Home button you are starting all over again (step 1 above)!\n* The 'Go to bottom' function is incompatible with scrollable preview!\n<<<\n",
