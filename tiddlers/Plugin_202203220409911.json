I am currently using it as an [[issue tracker and change log|http://inmysocks.tiddlyspot.com/#Change%20Log]] for the work I do with TiddlyWiki.\n\n__Description:__\n\nA list split into categories. You can see an example [[here|http://inmysocks.tiddlyspot.com/#Change%20Log]]. Clicking on a section title collapses that section, clicking on the {{$:/core/images/info-button}} icon gives information about the task, the checkbox marks the task as finished, the {{$:/core/images/edit-button}} lets you edit a task and the {{$:/core/images/cancel-button}} removes the task from the list, if you are using a task list.\n\n__Features:__\n\n*multiple independent lists are possibly by changing the `Tag` and `FinishedTag` parameters\n*task list or event list\n*collapsible categories\n*collapse all/expand all\n*searchable by title\n*searchable by category\n*searchable by tag\n*task creation interface\n*remove old entries (this just removes the tags that label it for the list, it doesn't delete the tiddler)\n*start dates\n*due dates*\n*task creation date*\n@@font-size:12px; *At the moment these values aren't used by the list, but I am planning on integrating the task list with my [[calendar plugin|http://inmysocks.tiddlyspot.com/#Calendar%20Plugin]] so that tasks entered on the list can be made to appear on the calendar. @@\n\n__Planned features:__\n\n*add sorting options\n*making more lists types (the display options will be different, there may not be other differences)\n*integration with the [[calendar plugin|http://inmysocks.tiddlyspot.com/#Calendar%20Plugin]]\n*searchable by due, start and creation dates\n*set events as finished once their date has passed\n*(possibly) allow an infinite number of nested categories, this may not be practical\n\n__Usage:__\n\n```\n<<CategoryList Tag:\"Task\" FinishedTag:\"Done\" ListType:\"Task\" ShowAddItem:\"True\" ShowSearch:\"True\" ShowFinished:\"True\">>\n```\n\n__Parameters:__\n\n|!Name |!Description |\n|~Tag |The tag used to indicate that a tiddler should be on the list (Default: Task) |\n|~FinishedTag |The tag added to finished tasks (Default: Done) |\n|~ListType |The type of list to make, options are Task and Event (Default:Task) |\n|~ShowAddItem |If this is set to anything other than `True` the `New Task` button doesn't appear. (Default: True) |\n|~ShowSearch |If this is set to anything other than `True` than the search interface is hidden. (Default: True) |\n|~ShowFinished |If this is set to anything other than `True` than the finished tasks/events are hidden. (Default: True) |\n\n__Notes:__\n\nIf you only want to have a single task list using the tags `Task` and `Done` than simply using `<<CategoryList>>` will work. If you want to have another list that is independent of the first list you can just put `<<CategoryList Tag:\"School Task\">>`. You can have as many lists as you want by changing the `TaskTag`, and if you want the `FinishedTag`.",
