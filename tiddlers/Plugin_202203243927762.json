See below.\n\nInspired by the CodeMirror plugin. Monaco Editor is licensed under MIT, copyright Microsoft. \n\n!! Disclaimer\nThis is very alpha-level code for now,\nso no guarantee that it will not delete\nall your text and tiddlers randomly, brick\nand/or otherwise corrupt your installation.\n\nOf course I don't expect that to happen\nand for what it's worth, I wrote this\nreadme with it, so it seems to work\nalright for what it is.\n\n!! Features\nA lot of the out-of-the-box features of Monaco\nalready work well.\n\n* Syntax highlighting and formatting for TiddlyWiki wikitext, HTML, JS, Markdown\n* Advanced multiselections and editing\n* Scrollbar minimap\n* Tiddler autocompletion\n* Hover tooltips with tiddler contents\n\n!! Limitations\n\n* ''Online only''. The Monaco editor source itself will be loaded remotely from `unpkg.com`, so editing while offline isn't possible at this point.\n* ''No configuration''. Yet?\n* ''Highlighting heuristics''. Wikitext highlighting might not always be accurate due to missing  TiddlyWiki parser text ranges. \n",
