Purpose\n\nProvides an alternative search result list that orders results by search relevance and ignores differences in word forms (ex. //tag// vs //tags//).\n\nOn my personal wiki, I have the problem that there are terms I use across a lot of tiddlers, and sometimes I'll use different forms (such as the aforementioned //tag// vs //tags//).  I wanted a plugin to allow me to find the tiddler I'm looking for quickly and didn't require me to worry about how I declined a noun or inflected a verb - so I wrote this plugin, which provides an alternative search list powered by [[lunr.js|https://lunrjs.com/]].\n\nI use it pretty much every day, but there's definitely room for improvement.  Please [[let me know|https://github.com/hoelzro/tw-full-text-search/issues]] if there are any bugs!\n\n! Demo\n\nPlease check out the [[examples|https://hoelz.ro/files/fts.html#Query Examples]] on the demo wiki.\n\n! Usage\n\nEach time you start a new ~TiddlyWiki session, you'll need to build the FTS index.  You can do this from a tab in the [[$:/ControlPanel]].  Older versions of the index are retained in web storage, so it should be pretty quick after the first time!  After you build the index, you can just search as you would normally.\n\n! Source Code/Reporting Bugs\n\nIf you want to help out, you can report bugs or check out the source for this plugin (or its dependency, the progress bar plugin) on ~GitHub:\n\nhttps://github.com/hoelzro/tw-full-text-search/\n\nhttps://github.com/hoelzro/tw-progress-bar\n\nRequires [[$:/plugins/hoelzro/progress-bar]] to display progress when generating the index.\n",
