Welcome to the ''[~TiddlyWiki Chinese Community Plugin Library]''!

This plugin source is maintained by the [[TiddlyWiki Chinese Community|https://github.com/tiddly-gittly]] and is dedicated to collecting all ~TiddlyWiki5 related plugins on the web, hoping to provide a one-click installation and update plugin experience for ~TiddlyWiki users all around the world.

If you don't know how to use ~TiddlyWiki and this source, you are welcome to read the plugins related section in the [[TiddlyWiki Tutorials for Chinese Communities|https://tw-cn.netlify.app]]. As mentioned above, both the plugin source and the tutorial are open source projects, you can find them in [[GitHub|https://github.com/tiddly-gittly]] and participate in contributing! If you like, you can join us through QQ groups and other means, see the Chinese tutorials mentioned above for details.

To add this plugin library to your Wiki, simply drag the link below to your Wiki with your mouse:

* <$link to="$:/config/TiddlyWiki-CPL/Netlify">{{$:/config/TiddlyWiki-CPL/Netlify!!caption}}</$link> The source version of this plugin is a version accelerated by netlify.app, which is more friendly to China mainland users, but there is a certain delay in updating.
* <$link to="$:/config/TiddlyWiki-CPL/GitHub">{{$:/config/TiddlyWiki-CPL/GitHub!!caption}}</$link> The source version of this plugin is the ~GitHub Page version, which is more up-to-date, but may require VPN when you are in China mainland. If you are in China and are not sure what GFW is, please use the above version.

Note: The content of the two is the same, only the former will be updated a little later. But both update the plugin information every hour, so it's not a big problem.
